One fascinating area of research uses GPS to track the movements of animals. It is now possible to manufacture a small GPS device that is solar charged, so you donâ€™t need to change batteries and use it to track flight patterns of birds.

The data for this case study comes from the LifeWatch INBO project. Several data sets have been released as part of this project. This is a small dataset that consists of migration data for three gulls named Eric, Nico, and Sanne.

The file contains eight columns and includes variables like latitude, longitude, altitude, and time stamps.
